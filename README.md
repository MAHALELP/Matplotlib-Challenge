README!

This project involved preparing, analyzing, and visualizing mouse study data.

Data Preparation:
Merged datasets containing mouse metadata and study results.
Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

Summary Statistics:
Calculated tumor volume statistics for each drug regimen.

Visualization:
Generated bar charts to display total timepoints for each drug regimen.
Created pie charts to show the gender distribution of mice.

Outliers Detection:
Identified potential outliers in tumor volume data.

Correlation and Regression:
Calculated correlation coefficients and performed linear regression analysis.

Conclusion:
The analysis provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of various drug regimens in treating tumors in mice. Further exploration is suggested to refine understanding and optimize treatment outcomes.
